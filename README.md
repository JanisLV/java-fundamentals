# Introduction

Welcome to the **Java Fundamentals** module!

During this module you will learn the core concepts of Java programming language. <br>
Many of the covered topics are applicable to other languages like C, C++, C# or Python.

Every part of the theory will be followed by the live coding session
and exercises that should be done individually, with an assistance of the trainer.

Some of the topics that are going to be explained during this module are:
- Data types, variables, constants, operators, casting
- String class
- Conditional statements, visibility
- Loops
- Arrays
- OOP (class, object, state, behaviour)
- Fields, methods, constructors, packages, imports

## Requirements

Before you start make sure that you have downloaded and installed required software:
1. OpenJDK 8 [Linux](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) [Windows](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download)
2. [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
3. [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 
# First Steps

1. Prepare **one** place on your computer where you will store all of the files and projects related to the Java course. (HINT: desktop is not a good place for that)
2. Download the project as a zip package (or if you are already familiar with GIT you can use it as well)
3. Unpack project to the prepared directory.
4. Using IntelliJ IDEA create new project using "Create project from existing sources" - point to the recently unpacked directory.
5. Use default setting during the whole creational process.
6. Wait for a couple of seconds as IntelliJ has to refresh the directory structure and all of the dependencies.
7. You are ready to go!
